# Personal Records System
Azubi Cloud Engineering Week 6 assignment

#### THE PROBLEM

The objective of this project is to enhance the functionality and
interactivity of the Personal Record Management System using Bash
scripting. By incorporating Bash scripts into the system, students will
be able to automate tasks, improve user experience, and add advanced
features to make the system more interesting and efficient.

#### DELIVERABLES

  * Design an interactive menu system using Bash scripting, allowing
    users to add a new record, edit existing records, search for
    specific records, and generating reports.
  * Develop a Bash script that automates the process of creating regular
    backups of the personal record file
  * Create a Bash script that generates strong and random passwords.
  * Use bash conditions and loops to create interactive scripts that
    prompt the user for input and perform different actions based on
    user responses.
